# Home page

Sometimes one wants to click on a link to check a website, but one doesn't want to send all the info that people put on the links you click. One can manually strip all the params in the url before going, but it can become annoying.

Setting up this index.html as home page provides one with an input field that will do the striping automatically for them.
